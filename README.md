## Description

A Twitter-like social media platform for posting, liking, and following users. Experience the familiar features of Twitter in this engaging project.

## Problems

- Build a user-friendly and engaging UI similar to Twitter's in a short timeframe of only 4 days.
- Integrate the frontend with a pre-existing backend API, ensuring seamless communication and data flow between the two.
- Implement robust error handling and messaging to ensure that users receive clear and helpful feedback when issues arise.

## Solutions

- Built the frontend using a pre-made template, while still customizing it to fit project requirements and ensuring a visually appealing design.
- Implemented additional features such as a trending section, user profile tooltips, dynamic follow button, and following page, to enhance the user experience. 
- Ensured the website was responsive, including designing and implementing responsive sidebars, to optimize the user experience on all devices.

## Challenges

- Implementing error handling for the backend API response and displaying user-friendly error messages was a significant challenge. I had to utilize the userContext and pass error messages through components to achieve this.
- Creating a seamless user experience was crucial, which meant implementing data fetching without page refreshes. I achieved this using React's useEffect hook and async/await functions.
